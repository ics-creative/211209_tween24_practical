              Scorpius is one of the constellations of the zodiac and is located in the Southern celestial hemisphere. Scorpius is one of the 48 constellations identified by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century.

              Scorpius contains many bright stars, including Antares (α Sco),
              "rival of Mars," so named because of its distinct reddish hue; β1
              Sco (Graffias or Acrab), a triple star; δ Sco (Dschubba, "the
              forehead"); θ Sco (Sargas, of unknown origin); ν Sco (Jabbah); ξ
              Sco; π Sco (Fang); σ Sco (Alniyat); and τ Sco (Paikauhale).
              Marking the tip of the scorpion's curved tail are λ Sco (Shaula)
              and υ Sco (Lesath), whose names both mean "sting." Given their
              proximity to one another, λ Sco and υ Sco are sometimes referred
              to as the Cat's Eyes.[2] The constellation's bright stars form a
              pattern like a longshoreman's hook. Most of them are massive
              members of the nearest OB association: Scorpius-Centaurus.[3] The
              star δ Sco, after having been a stable 2.3 magnitude star, flared
              in July 2000 to 1.9 in a matter of weeks. It has since become a
              variable star fluctuating between 2.0 and 1.6.[4] This means that
              at its brightest it is the second brightest star in Scorpius. U
              Scorpii is the fastest known nova, with a period of about 10
              years.[5] The close pair of stars ω1 Scorpii and ω² Scorpii are an
              optical double, which can be resolved by the unaided eye. They
              have contrasting blue and yellow colours. The star once designated
              γ Sco (despite being well within the boundaries of Libra) is today
              known as σ Lib. Moreover, the entire constellation of Libra was
              considered to be claws of Scorpius (Chelae Scorpionis) in Ancient
              Greek times, with a set of scales held aloft by Astraea
              (represented by adjacent Virgo) being formed from these
              westernmost stars during later Greek times. The division into
              Libra was formalised during Roman times
